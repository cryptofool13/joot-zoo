# JOOT-ZOO Curated Content
a website of aggregated content from various platforms ie reddit, youtube dev.to

## TODO
- wire up apis to fetch list of articles/videos
- build templates for fetched data
- set up cache to speed up server render
  - maybe have server re-request data once a day and store response in redis for subsequent requests
